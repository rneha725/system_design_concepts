Here are some tricky micro problems in distributed systems that will help you dive into more complex issues while giving you hands-on experience:

### 1. **Distributed Consensus with Partial Failures**
   - **Problem**: Implement a system where multiple nodes must agree on a single value, even in the face of partial failures (e.g., some nodes going down, network partitions).
   - **Challenge**: Use an algorithm like **Paxos** or **Raft** to ensure that consensus is reached, despite failures, without relying on a centralized coordinator.
   - **Hint**: Focus on managing leader election, log replication, and maintaining consistency under network partitions (e.g., split-brain scenarios).

### 2. **Designing a Fault-Tolerant Distributed Cache**
   - **Problem**: Build a distributed cache that can tolerate node failures while maintaining strong consistency (e.g., Redis cluster or Memcached with replication).
   - **Challenge**: Handle cache invalidation, replication, consistency (e.g., strong vs. eventual), and ensuring that no two clients get stale values during node failures or cache misses.
   - **Hint**: Explore cache coherency protocols like **write-through**, **write-behind**, and **read-repair** mechanisms.

### 3. **Designing a Sharded Database with Dynamic Resharding**
   - **Problem**: Design a distributed database that shards data across multiple nodes and dynamically adjusts shards as the data grows or shrinks.
   - **Challenge**: Handle data distribution with a **consistent hashing** scheme and reshard data when nodes are added or removed, ensuring minimal disruption to clients and balanced data storage.
   - **Hint**: Consider the challenges of **data rebalancing** without downtime, and **minimizing data movement** during resharding events.

### 4. **Building a Distributed Queue with Exactly-Once Semantics**
   - **Problem**: Implement a distributed message queue that ensures **exactly-once delivery** of messages, even in the presence of failures and retries.
   - **Challenge**: Solve the problem of deduplication of messages in a distributed system, handle network partition scenarios, and make sure messages arenâ€™t lost or processed multiple times.
   - **Hint**: Use techniques like **message IDs**, **idempotent operations**, and **write-ahead logging (WAL)**.

### 5. **Handling Distributed Transactions with Two-Phase Commit**
   - **Problem**: Implement a distributed transaction system using **2PC (Two-Phase Commit)**, ensuring atomicity across multiple services.
   - **Challenge**: Handle failure scenarios where the coordinator crashes after sending a commit message to some participants but before notifying others. Prevent inconsistent states or stuck participants.
   - **Hint**: Explore how 2PC can lead to blocking issues and investigate **Three-Phase Commit (3PC)** for better liveness guarantees.

### 6. **Leader Election with Network Partitions**
   - **Problem**: Implement a **leader election algorithm** in a distributed cluster where nodes can communicate via unreliable networks and may suffer network partitions.
   - **Challenge**: Ensure that there is exactly one leader at any given time (no split-brain scenarios), even when the network partitions or nodes fail.
   - **Hint**: Consider algorithms like **Bully**, **Raft**, or **Zookeeper's leader election**, and handle the tricky case of rejoining nodes after a network partition.

### 7. **Designing a Distributed Rate Limiter**
   - **Problem**: Build a distributed rate-limiting system that can throttle requests across multiple nodes in a cluster while maintaining consistency.
   - **Challenge**: Ensure that the rate limit is enforced correctly even when nodes are distributed and independent, without causing performance bottlenecks.
   - **Hint**: Explore approaches like **token buckets**, **leaky buckets**, or centralized limiters using a distributed store like **Redis** or **Etcd**.

### 8. **Handling Clock Skew in Distributed Systems**
   - **Problem**: Build a distributed log or event storage system where events are written to different nodes, but clocks across the nodes are not synchronized.
   - **Challenge**: Ensure that logs are ordered correctly despite clock skew or unsynchronized clocks between nodes. Handle cases where events may appear out of order.
   - **Hint**: Use techniques like **logical clocks** (e.g., **Lamport timestamps** or **vector clocks**) to ensure causality and correct ordering.

### 9. **Partitioned Data Store with Global Consistency Guarantees**
   - **Problem**: Design a distributed database where data is partitioned across different nodes, but the system needs to ensure **global consistency** (e.g., linearizability or serializability).
   - **Challenge**: Balance performance with strong consistency guarantees, especially under network partitions or failures. Ensure data integrity without sacrificing too much performance.
   - **Hint**: Investigate **quorum-based replication** and **Paxos-like protocols** to achieve global consistency while keeping performance reasonable.

### 10. **Eventual Consistency with Conflict Resolution**
   - **Problem**: Build a distributed key-value store that guarantees **eventual consistency**, where clients might receive different versions of the data, but eventually all replicas converge to the same value.
   - **Challenge**: Handle conflict resolution during merges, when different nodes store divergent data, especially in scenarios of concurrent updates.
   - **Hint**: Look into conflict-free replicated data types (**CRDTs**), **version vectors**, or operational transforms for automatic conflict resolution.

### 11. **Design a Distributed Lock Service**
   - **Problem**: Implement a **distributed lock service** (similar to **Zookeeper** or **Etcd**) where multiple clients can acquire locks on shared resources without race conditions.
   - **Challenge**: Handle situations where locks might expire or nodes might fail, leading to split-brain scenarios. Ensure safety, liveness, and fairness.
   - **Hint**: Use **fencing tokens** to ensure that stale lock holders cannot interfere with newer lock holders. Investigate **Zookeeper's ephemeral nodes** for automatic lock release upon failure.

### 12. **Building a Highly Available Distributed Notification Service**
   - **Problem**: Design a distributed notification service that ensures **at least once** delivery of messages to clients (e.g., SMS, email, push notifications) while minimizing duplicate notifications.
   - **Challenge**: Handle node failures, retries, and deduplication. Ensure that notifications are not lost, but duplicates are minimized.
   - **Hint**: Implement **message queuing with idempotency** and **deduplication logic** at the consumer level.

### 13. **Dynamic Leader Selection for Distributed Microservices**
   - **Problem**: In a microservice architecture, dynamically select a leader service (e.g., for task scheduling) from a pool of stateless services.
   - **Challenge**: Ensure that leader election happens reliably and consistently, even under network partitions or node failures, without causing race conditions.
   - **Hint**: Look into using distributed consensus protocols like **Raft** or **Etcd** for dynamic leader election.

### 14. **Designing a Distributed Scheduler with Time Drift**
   - **Problem**: Build a distributed scheduler where nodes are in different data centers and clocks may drift. Tasks need to be executed at specific times with precision.
   - **Challenge**: Handle time drift between different machines in different regions while ensuring tasks are scheduled as close to the intended time as possible.
   - **Hint**: Use synchronized clocks (e.g., **NTP**), **logical clocks**, or implement a **distributed quorum-based time coordination mechanism**.

### 15. **Implementing a Reliable Pub-Sub System with Fault Tolerance**
   - **Problem**: Build a **publish-subscribe system** where publishers send messages to multiple subscribers, and the system guarantees that every subscriber gets every message, even during node failures.
   - **Challenge**: Ensure durability, fault tolerance, and message deduplication. Handle the possibility of subscribers crashing and recovering later.
   - **Hint**: Use **Kafka-style partitioning**, **replication**, and **checkpointing** for fault-tolerant message consumption.

These problems will get you thinking about practical challenges in distributed systems, including fault tolerance, consensus, scalability, and consistency, helping you grow more proficient in the field.
