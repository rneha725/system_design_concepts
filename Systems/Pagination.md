Yes, querying the database for every page request can lead to inefficiencies, especially in systems that handle a large volume of data and concurrent users. There are multiple strategies to optimize pagination, and querying the entire dataset each time is usually not efficient for large datasets.

### Approaches to Pagination and Optimizing DB Queries:

1. **Offset-Based Pagination** (Not Ideal for Large Datasets):
   - **Description**: This is the most common form of pagination where you use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` SQL clauses to skip rows and return only a specific number of results.
   - **Drawback**: For large datasets, the `OFFSET` becomes inefficient. The deeper the page, the more rows the database needs to scan and skip, even though they aren't returned.
   
   **Example Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 100;
   ```

   For large datasets, this approach can become very slow, as the database must scan and discard the previous rows, which can cause performance bottlenecks.

2. **Keyset Pagination (a.k.a Cursor-Based Pagination)** (More Efficient for Large Datasets):
   - **Description**: Instead of using `OFFSET`, this approach uses a unique, indexed field (such as `id`, `created_at`, or another sequential field) to paginate by returning rows "after" a specific key or cursor.
   - **How It Works**: When a page request is made, the client sends the last key or ID from the previous page, and the query fetches the next set of rows that come after that key.
   - **Advantages**: It is much more efficient for large datasets since the database doesn't have to skip rows. It only fetches the next set of rows that come after the current page's last entry.

   **Example Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at < '2024-10-19 12:00:00' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

   Here, `created_at` from the last item on the current page is passed to fetch the next page.

3. **Caching the Results**:
   - **Description**: If the dataset is mostly static (or rarely changes), you can implement caching to avoid querying the database repeatedly for the same paginated data.
   - **How It Works**: You cache the query result when a user requests the first page, and store the subsequent pages in memory (like Redis, Memcached, etc.). When users request the next page, you serve it from the cache.
   - **Advantages**: This reduces database load significantly by handling multiple page requests in memory.
   - **Drawbacks**: Not ideal if data changes frequently, as you’ll need cache invalidation mechanisms.

   **Example**: 
   - Fetch the first page from the database and cache it.
   - When the user requests the second page, check the cache first. If it's present, return it from the cache, else fetch from the database.

4. **Precomputing Pages**:
   - **Description**: If your dataset is mostly static or changes infrequently, you can precompute pages of data and store them either in a cache or a separate table, which can be queried quickly.
   - **How It Works**: Periodically, a background job can precompute the pages and store them, so when a user requests a page, it's fetched instantly without complex queries.
   - **Advantages**: This method provides fast page retrieval with minimal database load.
   - **Drawbacks**: Not suitable for real-time dynamic data.

5. **Partitioned Table or Sharding**:
   - **Description**: If your dataset is huge and spans multiple partitions or shards, you can improve pagination by limiting queries to specific partitions or shards.
   - **How It Works**: Use table partitioning or database sharding to segment the data based on time, user IDs, or other logical groups. When paginating, the query only fetches results from relevant partitions, reducing the query complexity and improving speed.
   - **Advantages**: More scalable for large datasets, as each query only hits a subset of the data.
   - **Drawbacks**: Complex to implement and manage.

### Does Querying All Data Once and Returning a Part Make Sense?
For large datasets, **querying the entire data and only returning a part** (e.g., in memory filtering) is **not** a scalable approach. This will increase the amount of data transferred between the database and your application layer, leading to:

1. Increased memory consumption in your application.
2. Increased database load since the entire dataset needs to be fetched even though only part of it will be used.
3. Increased network latency, as you’re moving more data than necessary.

### Conclusion:
For most use cases with large datasets:
- **Keyset (cursor) pagination** is the best option for large datasets and high-traffic systems due to its efficiency and scalability.
- **Caching** can also be used effectively for static or slow-changing data to reduce the load on the database.
- For small datasets, **offset-based pagination** can be adequate, but it's important to optimize for larger datasets.

Querying the entire data and returning part of it is generally inefficient and should be avoided.
