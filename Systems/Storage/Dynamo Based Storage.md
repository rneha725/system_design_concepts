## Overview
Dynamo is a distrubuted kv storage architecture, it is designed to be **highly available**, scalable, eventually consistent and completely decentralized. Availbility is the preferred over consistency and flexibility is provided for consistency.

The architecture has influenced cassandra, dynamdb, voldemort etc.
## Uses
- **why is it developed**: to create a highly avaialable storage and although it can also provide high consistency(with performance compromises), it is not suitable for highly consistent use cases.
- **Use Cases**:
