### **What is Event Sourcing?**

Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern where **all changes to an application's state are stored as a sequence of events**. Instead of persisting the current state (e.g., a snapshot of an object or entity), the system saves all the events that led to the current state. These events are immutable and represent a change in the state of the system. To get the current state of an entity, you **replay the sequence of events**.

For example, in a banking application, instead of storing an account's balance directly, you would store the deposit and withdrawal events. To determine the balance, you replay these events in sequence.

### **Why is Event Sourcing Used?**

1. **Auditing and Traceability**: Since each state change is stored as an event, the entire history of state transitions is available. This is useful for auditing, debugging, or tracing the flow of the system.
2. **Reliable Reconstruction**: The current state can be reconstructed by replaying events. This allows the system to rebuild the state from scratch if necessary.
3. **Decoupling Components**: Event streams can be used to decouple various parts of the system, as different services can react to events independently. This also supports **[CQRS](../Design%20Patterns/Command%20Query%20Responsibility%20Segregation.md)** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), where the write model (events) is separated from the read model.
4. **Temporal Queries**: You can query the state of the system as it was at any point in time by replaying events up to that point.
5. **Flexibility**: If new requirements arise, the event history allows you to introduce new ways of processing or deriving data without changing the past events.

### **How Failures are Handled**

1. **Idempotency**: When replaying events, failures may occur. To ensure consistency, event processing must be **idempotent**, meaning applying the same event more than once should not result in incorrect state transitions. For example, updating a database with a withdrawal event multiple times should not result in multiple withdrawals.
   
2. **Event Replay**: In case of failures, since the events are stored, the system can **replay the events** from the event store to recover the current state. You can replay up to the last successfully applied event to restore state after a failure.

3. **Transactional Event Publishing**: When an event is stored, it should be published in a transactional manner (using a technique like a **two-phase commit**) to ensure that the event is not lost even if there's a failure during publishing.

4. **Compensation Events**: If something goes wrong (like a business logic error), you can use **compensation events** to revert the system to a previous state. Instead of undoing changes, you append new "reverse" events that compensate for the erroneous event.

### **Pros of Event Sourcing**

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Since all changes are stored as events, you have a complete and accurate history of everything that happened in the system, which is beneficial for compliance and debugging.
2. **Scalability**: Systems built using event sourcing can scale well because events can be stored in an append-only fashion, making writes fast and scalable.
3. **CQRS Support**: Event sourcing naturally pairs with CQRS, where the read and write models are separated, improving performance and scalability in read-heavy systems.
4. **Time Travel**: The ability to replay events means you can reprocess events and inspect the state of the system at any point in time.
5. **Recovery from Failures**: In case of system crashes, the event log allows you to rebuild the systemâ€™s state without losing data.
6. **Flexibility in Business Logic**: You can evolve business logic by applying new processes to old events, allowing you to reinterpret or refine how events are handled as requirements change.

### **Cons of Event Sourcing**

1. **Complexity**: Implementing event sourcing adds significant complexity to the system. You need mechanisms to store and replay events, ensure events are processed idempotently, and deal with versioning of events.
2. **Event Versioning**: Over time, the structure of events may change (due to changes in business rules). Managing different versions of events can be challenging.
3. **Performance**: Replaying a large number of events to compute the current state can be slow, especially for entities with a long event history. Snapshots (periodic saving of the current state) can mitigate this but add more complexity.
4. **Storage**: Storing every event can consume a lot of storage over time, especially for high-throughput systems. Snapshots help reduce the need to replay every event but don't reduce the event storage itself.
5. **Eventual Consistency**: Event sourcing systems are often eventually consistent, which can introduce challenges in guaranteeing data consistency in real-time scenarios.
6. **Hard to Debug**: While the event log is great for auditing, it can be difficult to trace bugs across a complex series of events, especially when events span multiple services.
7. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand how to handle event replays, consistency guarantees, and compensation strategies, which may be different from traditional CRUD-based systems.

### **Trade-offs**

- **Consistency vs Performance**: Event sourcing systems often rely on eventual consistency, which can improve performance but sacrifices immediate consistency. If immediate consistency is a requirement, event sourcing may not be the best fit.
- **Storage Overhead vs Flexibility**: Storing every event gives you flexibility in time travel and auditing, but it leads to higher storage requirements and more complicated event versioning.
- **Latency in Read Models**: If you are using event sourcing with CQRS, there can be a lag between the time an event is processed and when the read model is updated, leading to a delay in reflecting the current state.
- **Complexity in Versioning and Event Schema**: As your system evolves, you may need to deal with different event versions and data structures, adding complexity to the event-handling logic.

### **When to Use Event Sourcing**

Event sourcing is most useful when:
- Auditing and traceability are critical.
- Your system needs to retain the entire history of changes.
- You are working with distributed systems that benefit from decoupled services.
- You want to separate the read and write models for performance (CQRS).

It may not be worth the complexity if your system is relatively simple or if immediate consistency is paramount.
